Everything is set.

7
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,542
We strike tonight.

8
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:46,292
Shouldn't we wait?
We don't have the numbers.

9
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,167
We don't need numbers.

10
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:52,875
We have our anger.

11
00:00:53,917 --> 00:00:55,375
We have our grief.

12
00:00:56,667 --> 00:00:59,000
And for the first time in a century,

13
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:01,792
we have hope.

14
00:01:03,542 --> 00:01:07,500
I want you to meet someone
willing to risk everything for our cause.

15
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:09,458
Like all of us,

16
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:12,625
she has lost too much.

[indistinct murmuring]

My mother and my brother.

In the Siege of Ba Sing Se.

20
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:30,750
She works at the palace.

21
00:01:31,333 --> 00:01:34,833
She's willing to help us
at great personal risk.

22
00:01:34,917 --> 00:01:36,875
If she can summon the courage,

23
00:01:36,958 --> 00:01:38,208
so must we all.

24
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:42,833
Fire Lord Ozai must die tonight!

[Ozai] There is no way out.

31
00:02:38,042 --> 00:02:41,042
But you must have known
this was a one-way journey.

32
00:02:42,042 --> 00:02:45,000
Or did you expect my men
to just lay down their arms

33
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:47,542
after you slaughtered their Fire Lord?

34
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:50,625
We expected
that all decent Fire Nation citizens

35
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:52,875
would've welcomed
being freed from your tyranny.

36
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:53,958
[Ozai] Tyranny?

37
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:56,917
Don't you mean… unity?

38
00:02:58,042 --> 00:02:59,167
Prosperity?

39
00:03:00,417 --> 00:03:04,292
Are we not
the greatest nation in the world?

40
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:07,375
Have I not led us to the brink
of bringing the entire world

41
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:08,708
under one rule,

42
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,667
our rule,

43
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:15,083
to ensure an era of peace?

44
00:03:15,167 --> 00:03:16,542
At what cost?

45
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:19,000
How many more lives?

46
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:21,583
Will it take another century
of loss and suffering?

47
00:03:24,417 --> 00:03:27,083
Do not speak to me of loss.

[foreboding music playing]

49
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:33,417
My compliments on making it this far.

50
00:03:35,167 --> 00:03:37,958
Then again, we in the Fire Nation

51
00:03:38,042 --> 00:03:41,333
have always prided ourselves
on our resourcefulness.

52
00:03:41,417 --> 00:03:42,708
Isn't that right,

53
00:03:44,292 --> 00:03:45,292
Azula?

Yes, Father.

56
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,458
You may have stopped us tonight, Ozai,

57
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:07,000
but there is one out there
who cannot be stopped.

58
00:04:08,167 --> 00:04:10,750
The one who will restore balance
to the world.

59
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,417
The one who has returned to us.

60

The one who will restore balance
to the world?

63
00:04:29,542 --> 00:04:31,917
Can you believe
they think the Avatar has returned?

64
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Leave us.

[footsteps retreating]

00:04:41,667 --> 00:04:42,667
What's this?

67
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:46,708
[Ozai] A message from one of my commanders
in the Southern Seas.

68
00:04:46,792 --> 00:04:48,417
No one of any importance.

69
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:52,208
What he had to report, however…

70
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:56,875
Zuko has found the Avatar?

71
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:59,750
Your brother has done the impossible.

72
00:05:01,792 --> 00:05:03,583
Just as I had asked.

73
00:05:04,792 --> 00:05:06,792
[foreboding music playing]

74
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:14,667
The Avatar.

75
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:19,833
Really?

[sighs] I don't get it.

85
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:18,708
Basic bending forms
are mostly just physical movement,

86
00:06:18,792 --> 00:06:21,708
but when you get into the harder moves,
like the water whip,

87
00:06:21,792 --> 00:06:24,542
you really need to reach inside
and feel the energy flow.

88
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:29,000
The monks always told us

89
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:31,292
to find a place
where emotion meets spirit.

90
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:33,125
A place deeper than thought.

91
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:35,917
Tap into your feelings
and gather energy from them.

92
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:39,000
Tap into your feelings.

Wow. Uh…

96
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:01,708
That's okay. I bet it was my fault.

97
00:07:01,792 --> 00:07:03,542
I should never be a teacher.

98
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:05,792
The monks always said I never listened.

99
00:07:06,667 --> 00:07:07,667
Hmm.

100
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:10,500
I think that's what they said.
I never listened.

101
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:17,083
All the more reason for us
to get to the Northern Water Tribe, right?

102
00:07:17,667 --> 00:07:21,083
That's right. They've got the best
waterbending masters in the world.

103
00:07:21,167 --> 00:07:22,792
I might even listen to them.

104
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:28,833
Okay, it's time to go. We shouldn't
stay in the same place for too long.

I liked her too.

Yeah, she was cool.

110
00:07:53,917 --> 00:07:56,000
Of course, I have no idea
what she saw in you.

[Appa groans]

Look!

- What is it? Fire Nation?
- [Aang] No!

115
00:08:08,167 --> 00:08:09,167
I think…

116
00:08:11,042 --> 00:08:12,625
I think it's another Airbender!

117
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:16,667
[Sokka] He's headed for that mountain.

118
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:19,833
[Aang] That's no mountain!

119
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:21,250
That's Omashu!

120

[Appa grunts]

122
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:27,079
[Zuko] He could be anywhere.

123
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:28,966
He was headed north
when he left Kyoshi Island.

124
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,250
He'll need to stop for food and water.

125
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:34,958
He may be the Avatar,
but he still needs to eat and drink.

126
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,917
[Zhao] The population center, then.

127
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,458
- I can alert my contacts.
- [Zuko] No!

128
00:08:42,542 --> 00:08:45,667
I told you,
no one else can know of his existence.

129
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:47,792
Understood.

130
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:51,417
But if I may,
we have a window of opportunity

131
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,917
as long as the Avatar remains
in this area.

132
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,250
If he gets too far north…

133
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:59,750
There are Fire Nation forces everywhere.
They're sure to find out.

134
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:05,500
Which is why I suggest you allow me
to contact a few trusted sources.

135
00:09:06,292 --> 00:09:08,875
They don't need to be told
any more than necessary.

136
00:09:11,792 --> 00:09:13,792
[foreboding music plays]

137
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,250
Very good.

138
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:22,208
Commander Zhao's ship has arrived.

139
00:09:22,292 --> 00:09:24,792
Perfect timing. To the Fire Nation.

140
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,083
[sighs]

141
00:09:33,167 --> 00:09:34,167
I don't like him.

142
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:37,292
[chuckles]
He does have a disagreeable quality.

143
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:39,042
[man] I spoke to some of his crew.

144
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:42,542
Word is Zhao failed
his officer training program three times.

145
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:44,250
Did I ask for your opinion?

146
00:09:47,792 --> 00:09:48,792
My apologies.

147
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:57,125
He was only trying to help.

148
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:59,708
He was gossiping about a superior officer.

149
00:10:00,292 --> 00:10:03,792
- An officer you don't like.
- That's beside the point.

150
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:07,417
There is an order
to the way we do things here. Rules.

151
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:11,792
We are Fire Nation, even out here.

152
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:19,583
Especially out here.

153
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,750
Omashu was carved out
of a living mountain.

154
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,917
It's one of the wonders
of the Earth Kingdom.

155
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,500
Of the world, actually.

156
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:31,125
And they have
an incredible delivery system

157
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:33,333
that winds through the whole city.

158
00:10:33,417 --> 00:10:37,417
And the people there,
they're artists, scientists, builders.

159
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,792
Plus, the food there is amazing.

160

[guard] You! Step forward!

166

They don't take kindly
to outsiders in Omashu.

167
00:11:09,792 --> 00:11:11,667
What makes you think we're outsiders?

168
00:11:14,667 --> 00:11:15,833
No reason. [chuckles]

169
00:11:19,667 --> 00:11:20,667
Wait.

170
00:11:21,417 --> 00:11:25,542
We're new here,
but we have a friend we need to see.

171
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:29,583
We just could use
a little help getting inside.

172
00:11:42,542 --> 00:11:43,542
Sorry.

173
00:11:44,292 --> 00:11:45,958
It's either that or the turnip sack.

174
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:48,833
I'm sure you can make that look good too.

Omashu's one

178

Try as they might,

179
00:11:59,417 --> 00:12:01,583
Firebenders haven't been able
to take it yet.

180
00:12:01,667 --> 00:12:03,083
That's why they're so careful here.

181
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:06,083
So how do you know we're not a threat?

182
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:08,917
Just a feeling.

183
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,542
Oh wow.

Headed to market, as usual.

189
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:28,292
Oh, wasn't a great crop this month.

190
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:31,250
She told me
I wasn't watering the turnips enough.

191
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,375
Knew there was a reason I married her.

Uh, my… my brother-in-law
would agree if he could speak.

196
00:12:42,417 --> 00:12:43,667
Struck mute at birth.

197
00:12:45,042 --> 00:12:47,458
You'd be amazed
at how much he can say without words.

198
00:12:47,542 --> 00:12:49,583
Just the other day,
he made us laugh so hard...

199
00:12:49,667 --> 00:12:51,583
All right, that's enough. Move along.

My name is Sai.

What were you doing out there?

237
00:15:13,417 --> 00:15:16,042
I just landed. How was I to know
there'd be another bombing?

238
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:18,333
Bombing? You mean that wasn't an accident?

239
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,833
[Teo] Nothing the Fire Nation does
is an accident.

240
00:15:20,917 --> 00:15:22,167
The Fire Nation?

241
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,042
Yeah. Their spies
are everywhere in the city.

00:15:27,042 --> 00:15:29,042
[sighs] It's not safe anywhere these days.

Omashu can be a dangerous place.

[Sai] More water. More water.

245
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:38,875
You're an Airbender.
Do you realize what this means?

246
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:41,083
We finally have a way
to take the fight to the enemy.

247
00:15:41,167 --> 00:15:44,167
You could drop bombs on them.
Rain down destruction.

248
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:48,792
Air power is their weakness,
and you… you are air power.

249
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:54,333
Whoa.

250
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:57,917
Pretty great, huh?
Dad's the mechanist to the King of Omashu.

251
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,833
"Mechanist"?

252
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:02,667
Ah, just a fancy word for someone
who wastes a lot of time tinkering.

253
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:03,875
[Teo] Don't listen to him.

254
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:06,833
He's responsible for maintaining
the best parts of the city.

255
00:16:06,917 --> 00:16:09,292
Like our delivery system.
You've seen it, right?

256
00:16:09,792 --> 00:16:10,875
It's amazing.

257
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,125
I play but a small role.

258
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:16,917
Hey, if everyone in Omashu
were as dedicated as you,

259
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,375
this war would be over.

260
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:21,000
The Fire Nation would be
on their knees by now.

261
00:16:22,292 --> 00:16:23,292
Yes.

262
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:25,292
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

263
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:31,958
Well, we have our own part
to play in the war. Right, Aang?

264
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:34,625
Yes.

265
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:37,042
Yes, uh, which is why we have to go.

266
00:16:37,917 --> 00:16:40,833
[Teo] Oh, right. Of course.

267
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:44,583
Just promise me
you'll really stick it to the Firebenders.

268
00:16:44,667 --> 00:16:45,667
Make 'em pay.

269
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:50,708
- Sokka.
- This stuff is incredible.

270
00:16:50,792 --> 00:16:52,083
I mean, look at this.

271
00:16:52,167 --> 00:16:54,000
Those are for cleaning
under your toenails.

272
00:16:55,042 --> 00:16:56,333
It can get bloody.

273
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:01,333
Did you see the mechanism
on that sorting machine?

274
00:17:01,417 --> 00:17:04,708
It's spring-powered. Ingenious.
Should've done that with our kayak racks.

275
00:17:04,792 --> 00:17:07,250
- [man] It stopped the bleeding, I think.
- [woman] Ah! No!

276
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:09,375
[man] You're all right.

[grunts]

282
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:35,125
[Aang] This place used to be incredible.
A place I couldn't wait to see.

283
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:38,792
A place where amazing things were created,
not destroyed.

284
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:41,917
It's my responsibility
to help these people.

285
00:17:42,417 --> 00:17:44,125
How are you gonna do that?

286
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:46,292
Being the Avatar
isn't just about fighting.

287
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:49,625
It's about helping people,
like Teo and his father

288
00:17:50,417 --> 00:17:52,000
and everyone in this city.

289
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:54,917
What about getting to the North?

290
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,167
Didn't Kyoshi tell you
you had to get there to prevent a tragedy?

291
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:02,833
Yes, and I'm gonna do that,
but I have to do this too.

292
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:08,167
If I'm gonna save the world,
I have to do it one person at a time.

293
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:10,792
That's why I'm staying in Omashu

294
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:14,292
because I wanna help, and I think I can.

295
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:17,000
Because I'm the Avatar.

296
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:21,333
Now tell me about these bombings.

297
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:25,792
"He's done the impossible."

298
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:29,167
He's done nothing.
He spent three years on an ocean cruise

299
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:32,250
while I've been here
doing everything Father has asked.

300
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:44,167
Who's the one risking her life
to root out traitors?

301
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,042
Oh, that's right!

302
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,417
Tell us about your mission.
Were you nervous?

303
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,917
Was your life really in danger?

304
00:18:51,042 --> 00:18:54,375
Not really. People in the resistance
aren't the brightest of flames.

305
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:57,500
Then again,
what can you expect from peasants?

306
00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:59,875
At least you got out into the city.

307
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:01,500
Zuko may be banished,

308
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:04,333
but he's out there exploring the world.

309
00:19:04,417 --> 00:19:06,875
If I were him, I wouldn't wanna come back.

310
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:11,542
Yeah, well, all dear old Zuzu wants is

311
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:14,417
to make it back here
and take away everything I've worked for.

312
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,375
Technically, he is first in line
to be Fire Lord.

313
00:19:19,042 --> 00:19:20,667
Not that he deserves to be.

314
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:23,125
He doesn't, but now he has hope.

315
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,375
- And that's dangerous.
- [soldier] Retreat!

316
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,792
So what can you do about it?

317
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:34,042
You're here.

318
00:19:34,917 --> 00:19:36,292
He's out there.

319
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,125
There are always ways to get in the game

320
00:19:44,792 --> 00:19:46,750
if you know which pieces to play.

321
00:19:48,792 --> 00:19:50,917
[Teo] <i>The Avatar has returned.</i>

322
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,375
My mother told me stories of the Avatar
and how he'd return one day.

323
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:55,958
Dad, do you remember her stories?

324
00:19:56,042 --> 00:19:57,250
What I remember is

325
00:19:57,333 --> 00:20:00,125
that your mother was taken from us
by this cursed war

326
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:02,500
and everything we've had to do
to stay alive since then.

327
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:04,583
We worked hard,
and we kept our heads down.

328
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:08,583
- That's not how we'll change the world.
- But it is how we'll survive.

329
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:10,167
You pretend like you don't care,

330
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,708
but I know you hate the Fire Nation
as much as I do.

331
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:16,333
Why else would you build all this
if not to help our army?

332
00:20:17,042 --> 00:20:18,250
Like this.

333
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:21,875
That's just an experiment.
I can't even get the damn thing to work.

334
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:25,167
Look, I'm not here to cause any trouble.

335
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,875
All I want is to help.

336
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:32,458
I know how. I have a hunch about
where the bombers might be gathering.

337
00:20:32,542 --> 00:20:34,042
It's high up on the mountain.

338
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:38,125
Can't really reach there by myself,
but with your airbending…

339
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:43,625
Just there. The strongest updrafts
are in the morning, so we should fly then.

340
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:44,708
What, tomorrow?

341
00:20:44,792 --> 00:20:46,851
No, Teo, you're supposed to
help me with the airship.

342
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:49,917
I still need to fix the attitude control
before I show it to the generals.

343
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,250
I can help with that.

344
00:20:56,417 --> 00:20:59,125
My sources say
an Airbender was spotted there.

345
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:00,208
Omashu.

346
00:21:01,292 --> 00:21:02,458
Enemy territory.

347
00:21:02,542 --> 00:21:04,583
Indeed, but not to worry.

348
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:08,042
There are ways to gain entry
if you know the right people,

349
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:09,875
which I do.

350
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:13,875
I'll send two of my best men
to confirm the report.

351
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:16,042
- They can be in and out before...
- No.

352
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:19,917
Uncle Iroh and I will go. No one else.

353
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:23,042
As you wish.

354
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:26,667
I trust you understand the danger.

355
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:31,417
If anything happens in Omashu,
we won't be able to help you.

356
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,958
The prince and I will be fine.

357
00:21:35,292 --> 00:21:37,708
We know what it means to be on our own.

- Sh.

Fire Nation spies.

366
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:37,750
But that means the mechanist is a...

367
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:38,833
[man] Traitor.

368
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:49,625
Come on.

369
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
[suspenseful music continues]

370
00:23:03,708 --> 00:23:05,709
The mechanist
has been working for the Fire Nation,

371
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:08,833
building devices, selling secrets.

372
00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:11,458
Sokka and Aang. They're in danger.

373
00:23:11,542 --> 00:23:13,542
- I've gotta warn them.
- They'll be fine.

374
00:23:15,292 --> 00:23:18,208
The mechanist may be a turncoat,
but he's a coward.

375
00:23:18,292 --> 00:23:20,375
He'd never take any direct action.

376
00:23:20,458 --> 00:23:22,125
This one, on the other hand…

377
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:36,750
[Katara] Wait.

378
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:38,792
Who are you?

379
00:23:40,417 --> 00:23:41,625
They call me Jet.

[Teo] There's the cave.

387
00:24:25,208 --> 00:24:29,000
Your pursuit was so clumsy,
I wasn't sure you'd ever catch up.

388
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:32,375
Big talk for someone who's outnumbered.

[Jet] Awesome shooting there, Longshot.

408
00:25:44,792 --> 00:25:46,958
That was a mean swing, Pipsqueak.

409
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:52,250
Nice moves. I had a feeling
you knew how to handle yourself.

410
00:25:53,125 --> 00:25:55,500
- Really?
- Cool attack on that flamehead.

411
00:25:55,583 --> 00:25:56,625
Thanks, Pipsqueak.

412
00:25:57,625 --> 00:26:01,292
- He's The Duke. I'm Pipsqueak.
- Oh.

413
00:26:01,375 --> 00:26:03,917
It's great to have a Waterbender
on our side.

414
00:26:04,708 --> 00:26:06,250
Who are you people?

415
00:26:07,292 --> 00:26:08,625
We're the good guys.

416
00:26:09,625 --> 00:26:10,625
Oh.

417
00:26:17,792 --> 00:26:19,125
Where's he taking him?

418
00:26:20,458 --> 00:26:23,833
Don't worry. Pipsqueak knows
how to take out the garbage.

419
00:26:29,458 --> 00:26:30,333
You coming?

420

[mysterious music playing]

421
00:26:40,125 --> 00:26:42,583
And if you add plates here
and a vent here,

422
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:45,583
all you need to do is install
a bleed valve to regulate pressure.

423
00:26:46,167 --> 00:26:49,583
And you're saying you implemented this
with water-based transportation?

424
00:26:50,292 --> 00:26:52,167
Well, no, it's just an idea I had

425
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:55,625
to make our ice-dodging ships
more maneuverable.

426
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:57,625
[Sai] Oh.

427
00:26:57,708 --> 00:27:00,792
Very clever.
Your father must be proud of you.

428
00:27:04,208 --> 00:27:08,167
Yeah, um, Dad doesn't really pay attention
to stuff like this.

429
00:27:08,667 --> 00:27:12,292
He's got more important things
to worry about. He's a warrior.

430
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,417
The world is filled with warriors.

431
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:20,208
But there are far too few great engineers.

432
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:22,250
Engineer? [scoffs]

433
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:24,917
No, this is just a hobby.

434
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:29,750
My, uh… my role is to protect the village
and be a warrior, just like Dad.

435
00:27:29,833 --> 00:27:32,083
Protecting the ones we love is important,

436
00:27:32,167 --> 00:27:35,125
but I also know we must pursue
the talents that we've been given.

437
00:27:38,083 --> 00:27:40,708
Sokka, you're a gifted engineer.
Don't ignore that.

438
00:27:41,875 --> 00:27:45,083
It's not always easy to find your path
in life, but when you find it,

439
00:27:46,125 --> 00:27:47,583
you must embrace it.

440
00:27:51,875 --> 00:27:54,917
People who saw the bombings
also saw a burst of green flame.

441
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,417
Tincar salt burns green.

442
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:59,292
It's a mineral tanners use
to cure animal skins.

443
00:27:59,375 --> 00:28:01,375
They came up here
to dig it out of the mountain.

444
00:28:02,042 --> 00:28:03,833
Just stuff I picked up from my dad.

445
00:28:04,458 --> 00:28:07,083
- He must be really proud of you.
- I guess so.

446
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,917
I think he sometimes wishes
I was more like him.

447
00:28:12,917 --> 00:28:14,583
Don't get me wrong. He's incredible.

448
00:28:14,667 --> 00:28:17,000
After the Fire Nation
attacked our village,

449
00:28:17,083 --> 00:28:18,417
he kept us alive.

450
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,875
He built our life here.

451
00:28:20,792 --> 00:28:22,750
He's always said
that it's just me and him,

452
00:28:22,833 --> 00:28:24,583
and he'd do anything to protect us.

453
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,333
And you want him to do more.

454
00:28:27,417 --> 00:28:31,375
I want him to see that we have to do
everything we can to save the world

455
00:28:31,458 --> 00:28:33,458
because if not us, then who?

456
00:28:35,667 --> 00:28:37,667

00:28:42,167 --> 00:28:43,167

00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:44,250
Welcome.

[indistinct chatter]

460
00:28:48,583 --> 00:28:49,750
[man] I'm almost there!

461
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:51,250
Come on.

462
00:28:52,375 --> 00:28:53,542
[girl] Whoo!

463
00:28:53,625 --> 00:28:55,167
[woman grunting]

464
00:28:55,917 --> 00:28:56,917
You live here?

465
00:28:57,458 --> 00:28:59,958
We've had a few bases,
but this one's served us well.

466
00:29:00,042 --> 00:29:00,917
[boy] Yeah! Come on!

467
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,167
Firebenders haven't been able
to track us here.

468
00:29:04,292 --> 00:29:07,875
I still don't understand what Firebenders
are doing in the Earth Kingdom city.

469
00:29:08,458 --> 00:29:10,792
Well, Omashu isn't what it used to be.

470
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:15,208
In the old days, the city stood strong,
but as the war dragged on,

471
00:29:15,917 --> 00:29:19,583
the king lost his nerve,
grew tired, senile.

472
00:29:19,667 --> 00:29:23,625
Let corruption spring up all around him.
Fire Nation seeped in through the cracks.

473
00:29:23,708 --> 00:29:25,125
That's where we come in.

474
00:29:26,958 --> 00:29:29,792
So you just took it on yourselves
to fight the Firebenders?

475
00:29:30,375 --> 00:29:31,833
Well, if not us, then who?

476
00:29:33,417 --> 00:29:36,458
Everyone here
has lost someone to the Fire Nation.

477
00:29:37,708 --> 00:29:39,875
Families. Loved ones.

478
00:29:39,958 --> 00:29:42,875
We're orphans, refugees.

479
00:29:43,792 --> 00:29:45,500
At least, that's what we were.

480
00:29:46,125 --> 00:29:48,083
What are we now, Smellerbee?

481
00:29:48,167 --> 00:29:49,208
Freedom fighters!

482
00:29:49,292 --> 00:29:51,625
[fighters] Yeah!

483
00:30:02,833 --> 00:30:04,375
Someone was here recently.

484
00:30:19,708 --> 00:30:20,875
Here, look.

485
00:30:21,542 --> 00:30:24,958
If you mix tincar with salt water
and then boil it down, you get this.

486

Blasting jelly.

487
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:28,792
A few jars
could blow half the neighborhood sky-high.

What is it? What did you find?

489
00:30:41,583 --> 00:30:44,000
The Firebenders
weren't behind the explosion.

490
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,875
[Jet] My mother was
the fighter in our family.

491
00:30:49,958 --> 00:30:54,417
She taught me the blade,
which, back then, was just a stick.

492
00:30:55,167 --> 00:30:58,958
When the Fire Nation came to our village,
she held them off while

493
00:31:00,208 --> 00:31:01,625
my dad hid me in a well.

494
00:31:04,583 --> 00:31:08,500
I wanted to fight,
but… he wouldn't let me.

495
00:31:10,583 --> 00:31:11,583
I was eight.

[somber music playing]

[voice breaking] And when I came back up…

498
00:31:21,833 --> 00:31:22,958
they were all gone.

499
00:31:48,833 --> 00:31:51,125
[Katara] I know what it's like
to lose family too.

500
00:31:55,042 --> 00:31:58,250
It was quiet… the night my mom died.

501
00:32:03,583 --> 00:32:05,000
Until the soldiers came.

I try not to think about it.
But recently, it's been coming back to me.

506
00:32:22,917 --> 00:32:25,125
I think it's been affecting my bending.

507
00:32:27,792 --> 00:32:31,875
I don't know anything about bending,
but I do know

508
00:32:31,958 --> 00:32:36,458
that you have to use
everything inside you to help you fight.

509
00:32:37,792 --> 00:32:41,333
Tell me, what do you remember
when you think of your mother?

510
00:32:43,958 --> 00:32:47,292
I don't mean how she died.
I mean when she was alive.

511
00:32:53,083 --> 00:32:54,125
I remember

512
00:32:55,833 --> 00:32:58,333
her getting up every morning
before everyone else.

513
00:33:01,417 --> 00:33:02,625
I remember

514
00:33:04,083 --> 00:33:05,708
seeing her outside the hut,

515
00:33:06,833 --> 00:33:09,625
getting to work, preparing breakfast.

516
00:33:12,333 --> 00:33:13,708
And every day,

517
00:33:14,875 --> 00:33:16,833
she would stop when the sun rose.

518
00:33:19,333 --> 00:33:21,083
She would watch it and smile.

519
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:23,500
Every day.

520
00:33:28,875 --> 00:33:29,917
Remember that.

521
00:33:32,083 --> 00:33:33,583
Remember the sunrise.

We don't have to be afraid of our pain.

We just need to decide
what we're gonna do with it.

- Trying some Omashu barbecue.

529

It's not often you get the opportunity.

530
00:34:52,458 --> 00:34:56,333
This is the great Omashu,
the best the Earth Kingdom has to offer?

"Charm"?

533
00:35:02,792 --> 00:35:04,833
You mean the dirt, the noise, the…

I'm told that Fire Nation agents
in the city have taken to sowing terror

538
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:23,875
to weaken the Earthbenders' resistance.

539
00:35:24,958 --> 00:35:27,708
That's not right. Warriors don't hide
their faces in a fight.

Father would never approve
of this underhanded tactic.

541

Given how long this war has lasted,

Uh, I haven't seen her all day.
I was helping Sai with his airship model.

564
00:36:49,417 --> 00:36:52,833
He just left to show it to the generals
at the palace. Why? What is it?

565
00:36:53,417 --> 00:36:56,137
Teo and I found where the bombers
have been getting their explosives.

566
00:36:57,083 --> 00:36:59,875
They're making blasting jelly
in a cave up on the mountain.

567
00:37:01,083 --> 00:37:02,083
Blasting jelly?

568
00:37:02,167 --> 00:37:06,500
That's not all. We also found these.
The robes from the turnip cart.

569
00:37:08,208 --> 00:37:11,917
So it wasn't the Firebenders
behind the explosion? It was...

570

You're not gonna believe this.
I know who's behind the bombings.

What?

- No, Jet's not the bad guy. Sai is.
- Are you kidding me?

573
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:24,833
Sai has done nothing but help us.
Jet's a con artist who lied to our faces.

574
00:37:24,917 --> 00:37:27,500
- He didn't lie.
- He didn't tell the truth.

575
00:37:28,667 --> 00:37:29,875
Because he couldn't!

576

He's fighting the Firebenders,
and he has to protect himself.

You don't know what he's already lost.

to the Firebender. He's the traitor.

with the king's men to root out spies.

And that's it? That's why you've been
